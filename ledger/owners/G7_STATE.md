# G7 Owner Checkpoint — Gauntlet Control and Convergence

Append-oriented. Each transition is persisted before the next action so a crash loses minutes, not hours. Times are Europe/Berlin (`UTC+02:00`), matching `ledger/RUN_LEDGER.md`.

## Identity and scope

- Owner: G7 gauntlet/convergence owner; sole owner of the gauntlet record.
- Model identity: `claude-opus-4-8`, effort `xhigh`. Process evidence at 16:57:43: parent PID 2995643 runs `/home/joseph/.local/bin/claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --model claude-opus-4-8 --effort xhigh`. Harness self-report: Opus 4.8, model ID `claude-opus-4-8`.
- Exclusive writable paths: `gauntlet/**` and `ledger/owners/G7_STATE.md`. Nothing else, at any point in this run.
- Controlled exception recorded, not exercised by me: fresh reviewers append their own assigned section of `gauntlet/ROUND_LOG.md`; root guarantees one active round writer at a time.

## Standing prohibitions I operate under

I do not run a review myself; I do not edit a reviewed artifact or another owner's file; I do not touch shared ledgers or canon (`ledger/RUN_LEDGER.md`, `ledger/ORCHESTRATION_STATE.md`, `DISPUTES.md`, `INDEX.md`, Charter set, Rev 7, definitions, re-audit); I create no beads, pseudo-bead inventories, source, or scaffolding; I contact no prohibited PDF processor source or documentation; I measure nothing against any other library; I take no external action; I write no SpecCard semantic body; I let no claim-vocabulary leakage through. Findings routed to me by root are recorded and dispositioned, never repaired by me.

## Transition log

### 16:57 — ACK (INGEST entered)

Assignment received and acknowledged on disk before broader work, per the human's explicit order.

- Read in full so far: `AGENTS.md` (including the G0 extension), `OVERNIGHT_GOAL.md`, `ledger/prompts/OWNER_MARCHING_ORDERS.md` (shared contract plus the G7 section), `ledger/prompts/GAUNTLET_REVIEWER_PROTOCOL.md`, `ledger/ORCHESTRATION_STATE.md`, `ledger/RUN_LEDGER.md`, `INDEX.md`.
- Still to read before DRAFT, per the shared owner contract: `MONKEYBEE_CAMPAIGN_CHARTER_v1.md`, `CYCLE_0_WORK_ORDER.md`, `AUDIT_FINDINGS_LEDGER.md`, `DISPUTES.md`.
- Owner FSM: `INGEST`. Next transition condition: authority chain fully ingested, then initialize `gauntlet/ROUND_LOG.md` and `gauntlet/CONVERGENCE_REPORT.md` with provenance and the precommitted R01–R30 allocation, and persist `DRAFT`.

Human correction received mid-turn and obeyed: the authoritative convergence path is `gauntlet/CONVERGENCE_REPORT.md`, exactly as `ledger/prompts/OWNER_MARCHING_ORDERS.md` and `OVERNIGHT_GOAL.md` §2 state. `gauntlet/CONVERGENCE.md` will not be created. No conflicting file was written before the correction arrived, so nothing needs unwinding.

Open risks at ACK:

- The R01–R12 block reviews `plans/CYCLE_1_DELTA_PLAN.md`, whose owner (G3) is still `DRAFT` per `ledger/ORCHESTRATION_STATE.md`. No round may be admitted against an artifact that has not reached `SUBMIT-FOR-REVIEW`, and no artifact hash exists to bind a round to until it does. I stay in `DRAFT` after initialization and wait for root-routed packets rather than pulling work forward.
- Reviewer processes are stateless and root-controlled. I do not spawn them, and I record no round I did not receive.

### 17:01 — INGEST complete; DRAFT entered

Authority chain fully ingested. Beyond the ACK list, read in full: `MONKEYBEE_CAMPAIGN_CHARTER_v1.md`, `CYCLE_0_WORK_ORDER.md`, `AUDIT_FINDINGS_LEDGER.md`, `DISPUTES.md`.

Initialized both G7 artifacts, append-oriented, with provenance headers:

- `gauntlet/ROUND_LOG.md` — control facts, model identity law, the round entry schema, the immutable five-pass prompt, the precommitted R01–R30 allocation with hash/status/counts/disposition slots, a status vocabulary, seven admission gates, and the reallocation log. No round is filed; the log states that plainly.
- `gauntlet/CONVERGENCE_REPORT.md` — findings-per-round and per-artifact curve tables (empty), the per-artifact phase model, the convergence and reallocation rule, cross-model accounting, five-pass block tracking, lens coverage, artifact coverage, and the instrument's limitations. It states that zero rounds have run and that nothing in it yet supports any statement about any artifact's quality.

Verifications performed at initialization (own arithmetic, against the root-owned allocation):

- Block sizes are 12/6/4/4/2/2 = 30, matching the OVERNIGHT_GOAL §4 budget.
- The model sequence yields 15 `gpt-5.6-sol` and 15 `claude-opus-4-8` rounds, matching the precommitted baseline cross-model count.
- The five-pass prompt is reproduced byte-for-byte from `ledger/prompts/GAUNTLET_REVIEWER_PROTOCOL.md`, inside a fenced block so no markdown quote prefix contaminates it.
- Rule 13 claim-vocabulary scan over all three G7-owned files: no leakage. The only hits from a deliberately over-broad grep are the word "guarantees" in `root guarantees one active round writer at a time`, carried verbatim from the root contract; it describes orchestration, not a product claim.

Three precommitments and coverage gaps recorded on the record, before any round runs:

1. **`marginal-only` defined** as *zero Grade-A and zero Grade-B findings in the round*. The reviewer protocol requires the field but never defines it, while OVERNIGHT_GOAL §4 makes two consecutive marginal-only rounds the convergence-and-reallocation trigger. Fixing it before results exist is the point: an undefined threshold is a threshold that can be tuned after the fact. This is my operationalization of a term the goal left open — it belongs on the morning ratification queue, and root or the human may overrule it.
2. **`kernel-touch audit` is an unallocated lens.** OVERNIGHT_GOAL §4 names it in the rotation; no round in R01–R30 declares it. The Charter makes kernel-touch risk #5 and §34.9 requires a kernel-touch declaration in every delta plan. If the baseline runs as precommitted, that lens is unreviewed and the convergence report will say so at close. The allocation is root-owned; I surface, I do not amend.
3. **`human_actions/**` receives no dedicated round.** These are the artifacts whose defects leave the repository. `ledger/ORCHESTRATION_STATE.md` allows an added block only after the priority floor is safe, which is the right priority under the goal's ladder; the gap is recorded rather than quietly accepted.

Open risks carried forward:

- R01–R12 target `plans/CYCLE_1_DELTA_PLAN.md`, whose owner is still `DRAFT`. Admission gate 1 blocks every C1 round until G3 reaches `SUBMIT-FOR-REVIEW` and root binds an artifact hash. This is expected, not a failure.
- R19–R22 review read-only canon, so their artifact hash cannot change between rounds and the same-artifact revision gate cannot apply. The read-only-canon exception is written into the round log: consecutive rounds are admitted against an unchanged hash, and graded defects route to G6 rather than to an in-place fix.
- Owner FSM: `DRAFT`, and it stays there. Per the human's explicit order I remain in `DRAFT` after initialization and wait for root-routed fresh reviewer packets. I do not advance to `SELF-CHECK` or `SUBMIT-FOR-REVIEW` on my own schedule, do not spawn reviewers, and do not pull round work forward. Next transition condition: root routes a filed reviewer packet, or root directs a transition. Each routed packet is validated, dispositioned, and persisted here before the next action.

### 17:04 — Root authorizes supplemental rounds R31–R32; recorded; still DRAFT

Root authorized two supplemental rounds without altering the precommitted R01–R30 baseline. Both close coverage gaps I recorded at initialization, and both were authorized **before any round had filed** — no curve was visible, no artifact had survived anything, and there was no result to tune them against. That ordering is what makes them evidence rather than a moving target, and it is stated on the record in both artifacts.

- **R31** — `plans/CYCLE_1_DELTA_PLAN.md`; one lens, `kernel-touch audit`; `gpt-5.6-sol` at `ultra`; admitted immediately after R12 and the owner's revision, which supplies the new artifact hash that admission gate 3 requires. Closes open process observation 1.
- **R32** — `human_actions/**`; one lens, `source-scope-and-no-action integrity`; `claude-opus-4-8` at `xhigh`; admitted after the R01–R30 priority floor, and after G5 reaches `SUBMIT-FOR-REVIEW`. Closes open process observation 2.

Recorded in `gauntlet/ROUND_LOG.md` (new supplemental-rounds section, `AUTHORIZED` status, per-round admission notes, R32 directory-hash rule) and `gauntlet/CONVERGENCE_REPORT.md` (curve, cross-model, lens-coverage, and artifact-coverage tables). The baseline is untouched: no round renumbered, retargeted, re-lensed, or reassigned; supplemental rounds carry the same schema, grade, admission, model-identity, and termination laws as baseline rounds.

Judgment calls I made while recording, all fixed before any round runs:

- **Supplemental rounds are labeled supplemental everywhere.** Baseline and supplemental coverage stay distinguishable so neither inflates the other.
- **A first application of a lens cannot by itself establish convergence.** R31 lands at position 13 in C1's sequence, which the phase model calls polish, but it is the first look under its lens. Grade-A findings from it would not contradict a falling curve, and a marginal-only R31 would not establish C1 convergence. Without this rule, adding a fresh lens late could manufacture a convergence signal from a lens that had only just started looking.
- **R32's lens is not in the OVERNIGHT_GOAL §4 rotation.** Root has the authority to declare it and it fits the artifact well. It is tracked in a separate coverage table so "the goal's lenses" and "lenses root added" never blur.
- **R32 needs a directory identity.** Precommitted the same manifest rule used for the whole-repo rounds: SHA-256 over the sorted list of `<sha256>  <path>` lines under `human_actions/`. That scope currently holds ten files (`README.md`, `OUTREACH_TRACKER.md`, `P1`–`P8`); the hash binds at assignment over whatever the directory then contains.

Ratification queue from G7 is unchanged at one item: the `marginal-only` definition (zero Grade-A and zero Grade-B findings) remains my operationalization of a term the goal left open.

Owner FSM: still `DRAFT`. Zero rounds are filed; nothing in the gauntlet record yet supports any statement about any artifact's quality. Next transition condition is unchanged: root routes a filed reviewer packet, or root directs a transition.
