# Orchestration State

## Global state

- Active subgoal: `G3`, with G1/G2/G4/G5 parallel owners staged behind the flagship start
- Current phase: `G0 DONE; next owner wave authorized`
- Priority rule: preserve G0, ledger, G3, G3 gauntlet, G1, and `MORNING_REPORT.md`; shed work only from the bottom of the governing ladder.
- Canonical-input mutation allowance: none.
- Bead/code allowance: none.
- External human-bound actions: drafts only.
- Review artifacts: findings only; reviewers never edit owner artifacts.

## Owner finite-state machines

Each owner must persist a checkpoint below and in its partial output at every transition:

`INGEST -> DRAFT -> SELF-CHECK -> SUBMIT-FOR-REVIEW -> REVISE -> DONE`

| Owner | Scope | Files owned | State | Last checkpoint | Next transition condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G0 owner | orientation, inventory, Grade-A verification | `INDEX.md`, `reports/INGEST_REPORT.md`, `ledger/owners/G0_STATE.md`, permitted AGENTS extension | DONE | All five fresh-review findings resolved; closure suite and root verification passed | None; terminate owner process |
| G1 owner | Constitution v8, shell corpus, fix map | `constitution/**`, `shell/**`, `reports/FIX_APPLICATION.md`, `ledger/owners/G1_STATE.md` | INGEST | G0 authority map available; launch staged after G3 | Governing kernel and OPEN-C0 findings ingested |
| G2 owner | resolve-now and deferred decisions | `decisions/**`, `ledger/owners/G2_STATE.md` | INGEST | G0 authority map available; launch staged after G1 | Work Order decision set and constraints ingested |
| G3 owner | Cycle 1 delta plan | `plans/CYCLE_1_DELTA_PLAN.md`, `ledger/owners/G3_STATE.md` | INGEST | G0 authority map available; flagship launches first | C1 authority sections and proposed defaults ingested |
| G4 owner | traceability matrix and C2-C7 briefs | `reports/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`, `plans/cycle_briefs/**`, `ledger/owners/G4_STATE.md` | INGEST | G0 authority map available; launch staged after G2 | Charter Q2/Q3 and cycle boundaries ingested |
| G5 owner | human-action packages | `human_actions/**`, `ledger/owners/G5_STATE.md` | INGEST | G0 authority map available; launch staged after G4 | Work Order day-zero actions ingested |
| G6 owner | conditional charter successors | qualifying `*_v1.1.md` files only | INGEST | Dormant unless graded defect qualifies | A genuine charter-set defect survives triage |
| G7 owner | gauntlet records and convergence | `gauntlet/**` | INGEST | Lens allocation imported from goal | Owner artifacts reach SUBMIT-FOR-REVIEW |
| G8 owner | integrity gate and morning handoff | `MORNING_REPORT.md`, final `INDEX.md`, ledger seal | INGEST | Terminal criteria imported from goal | G0-G7 dispositions are available |

## Reviewer finite-state machine

Every gauntlet instance is a fresh-context, single-shot machine:

`SPAWNED -> INGEST-DECLARED-CHAIN -> APPLY-ONE-LENS -> FILE-GRADED-FINDINGS -> TERMINATED`

It may write only its assigned finding packet. The G7 owner serially integrates packets into `gauntlet/ROUND_LOG.md`; the artifact owner triages and revises before the next round. Exact model identity, lens, count by grade, disposition, and termination are required ledger fields.

## Precommitted baseline gauntlet allocation

Model labels below are exact launch targets: `Sol` means `gpt-5.6-sol` at `max` or `ultra`; `Opus` means `claude-opus-4-8` at `xhigh`. A round may not silently fall back to another model.

| Rounds | Artifact | Declared lens | Model sequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | C1 delta plan | envelope-dependency | Sol |
| 02 | C1 delta plan | PDF-normative-fact | Opus |
| 03 | C1 delta plan | clean-room contamination | Opus |
| 04–08 | C1 delta plan | exact repeated blunder/oversimplification hunt; preserve features | Sol, Opus, Sol, Opus, Sol |
| 09 | C1 delta plan | obscure-section self-containment | Opus |
| 10 | C1 delta plan | dependency soundness | Sol |
| 11 | C1 delta plan | security/DoS | Opus |
| 12 | C1 delta plan | claim vocabulary and de-slopification | Sol |
| 13 | Constitution + fix map | identity-law consistency | Sol |
| 14–18 | Constitution + fix map | exact repeated blunder/oversimplification hunt; preserve features | Opus, Sol, Opus, Sol, Opus |
| 19 | Charter-set cross-consistency | envelope-dependency | Sol |
| 20 | Charter-set cross-consistency | Q2/Q3 traceability | Opus |
| 21 | Charter-set cross-consistency | duplication/drift | Sol |
| 22 | Charter-set cross-consistency | claim-vocabulary legality | Opus |
| 23 | traceability + cycle briefs | Q2/Q3 zero-orphan audit | Sol |
| 24 | traceability + cycle briefs | dependency soundness | Opus |
| 25 | traceability + cycle briefs | oversimplification hunt | Sol |
| 26 | traceability + cycle briefs | clean-room contamination | Opus |
| 27 | decision briefs | reversibility and dependency blast radius | Sol |
| 28 | decision briefs | security/DoS | Opus |
| 29 | whole repository | clean-room contamination | Opus |
| 30 | whole repository | coherence and de-slopification | Sol |

Baseline cross-model count: 15 Opus rounds. Rounds 02, 03, 11, 26, and 29 directly weight the PDF-normative, security, and clean-room lenses requested by the human. Extra five-pass blocks may be added for traceability, decisions, and human-action packages only after the priority floor is safe.

## Stop conditions

The run reaches `DONE` only after the wake-up test passes, required artifacts and gauntlet records exist, integrity scans have dispositions, the ledger is sealed provisionally, `MORNING_REPORT.md` names every ratification and omission, changes are committed and pushed, and `git status --short` is empty on `main`.
